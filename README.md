# MathChangeCalculations
 Math Change Calculations using a start value, an end value, periods, and percent change. 
 These four functions can handle all cases algebraically where three of four 
 variables are known: Start number, end number, percent change, and periods.
 Note: The precision of some calculations may be affected by floating point 
 operations.
